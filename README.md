# ng-sidebar-layout

This project shows the use of Angular directives with Bootstrap to create a mobile compatible sliding sidebar layout.

The menu slides out from the left on mobile and sticks to the left on large than mobile.

This sidebar was originally ripped from another theme, but I heavily modified it and fixed many of the CSS and even Angular bugs that existed and after basically recoding massive parts, made it my own.
